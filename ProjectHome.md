[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a free editable map of the whole world, made by volunteers and available under an open license.

[TERYT](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERYT) is a Polish national registry of administrative division of the country. Its public part provides the official list of voivodeships, powiats, gminas, cities, villages, other places and even streets all with unique identifiers.

This project is supposed to connect those two together for the benefit of the OpenStreetMap community.
